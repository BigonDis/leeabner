I thought it might be good idea to put my goals for the year out there to see if making them public would help make me be more accountable about achieving them.  I generally set some pretty aggressive goals for each year and don’t end up making most of them, so we will see how this goes.

1. **Start a Blog** - I guess I am well on my way to achieving this, I guess if I ever do more than just write this and actually get it posted somewhere.  I will probably do a whole post on why I want to do a blog separately.
2. **Acheive a certification.** - There are not certifications that I have to have to do my job, but a lot of things I am  interested in.  The top candidates for certifications this year would be the AWS Solutions Architect Associates certification, the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP).  I fear the OSCP exam, so that one might be my stretch goal.
3. **Read 25 books in the year.** - This isn’t just a goal of reading 25 technical books, I am not sure how many technical books I have ever read cover to cover, but rather this is about reading in general.  This will probably end up being mostly novels that I read, but hopefully there will be a couple of biographies and non-fiction books in there as well.
4. **Improve my Web Development Skills.** - I know that for work, I am being asked to consolidate and update the website, and I knew just enough the last time to get something out there, but to move it to the next level, I am going to have to improve my skills in this area.  The things I need to improve on are updating my Bootstrap knowledge to include the new version.  Since Bootstrap has gone to SASS over LESS, I will need to update that skill as well.  I would also like to become more proficient in javascript.
5. **Lose 50 pounds** - I realize this blog is more geared toward what I do technically, at least that is my intention, but I wanted to get this out there, because if I need accountability for anything it is my weight loss.
