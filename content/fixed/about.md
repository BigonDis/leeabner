Hello, World!, isn’t that how you are supposed to start these types of things?  My name is Lee Abner and I have been working in technology for close to 30 years now.  I have seen a lot of technologies come and go.   I have seen enough to know that change is the only constant and this blog is my journey of change and learning.

## Personal Life
I have a beautiful wife Jennifer and two children, Sarah and John.  Jennifer and I are now empty nesters, living in Central Illinois.  The line between work and hobby often gets blurred for me, since I love technology and learning new things, it often doesn’t feel like work.  Outside of technology, I love to read and enjoy going to sporting events, especially Chicago Cubs games.  I am slo a Big Walt Disney World Fan, hence my twitter handle, [BigOnDis](https://twitter.com/BigonDis).  I have been going to Disney World since it first opened in 1971.  

## Professional Life
I started, like most IT professionals that have been around for a while, building and supporting personal computers.  After college, my first job was working for my local municipality supporting their desktops, network, and server.  I moved on to a consulting role, with a mid-sized accounting firm here in the midwest, doing mostly the same stuff, but for clients.  I also was able to do some work on the corporate network, which exposed me to different technologies.  This is all back when Novell was the server operating system of choice.   I then moved to the company I am at now, which is a small community bank in the midwest , and have been here for the last 18 years.  I started out as a server admin and moved up/survived to be the Director of Technology Services / Chief Information Security Officer.  In this time period I did some  work as a consultant at a large insurance company in security, specifically in cryptography, but I was only there for about a year and came right back to the bank.

As part of a small IT staff, there are only five of us in IT, we all have to wear multiple hats, so I guess I am a bit of a Jack of all trades kind of person.  My role in general is responsibility for all the servers, desktops, networks and security at the bank.  I spend most of my time focused on the servers and security side of things.
